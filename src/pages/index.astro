      <h1>Abutalib-Barish Namazov</h1>
      <p>
        I am an engineer focused on computer science and software engineering. I
        grew up in Baku, Azerbaijan and graduated with an undergraduate degree
        from MIT in May 2024. My <a href="/about">about page</a> has a bit more.
        You can also check out my setup and tools I use in
        <a href="/computing">computing page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I am eager about too many areas of computer science, lately I have
        been thinking more about software design and modularity, especially in
        web development. You can reach out to me via <a
          href="mailto:hello@barish.me">email</a
        >.

        I am not currently looking for a job, but I am always interested in
        talking about ideas and products. You can take a look into my <a
