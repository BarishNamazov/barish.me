  <h1>Abutalib-Barish Namazov</h1>
</div>

Hey there! My name is Abutalib, but I usually go by Barish in casual
settings. I graduated from MIT in May 2024 with an undergraduate degree in
Computer Science and Engineering. Even though I try to educate myself in all
areas of computer science, these days I am mostly interested in solving the
problems of software modularity and web development. I enjoy teaching
others, as well as creating educational content.

Other than academics and related work, I enjoy playing video games and
watching TV series. The latest show I watched was [The Wire](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/),
and it was absolutely fantastic.

Currently, I am working on a few projects that are not ready to be announced.
The things I have done in the near past include:

- Teach [6.101/6.009](https://py.mit.edu/spring24) in Spring 2024.
- Work on [Kodless](https://github.com/BarishNamazov/kodless) as part of my [SuperUROP](https://superurop.mit.edu/scholars/abutalib-namazov/?scholar-cohort=648&scholar-page=1) in Spring 2024.
- Teach [Winter Camp 2024](https://tedbilik.github.io/kamp2024/) with voluntary support of more people, continuing the tradition I started in 2023.

I don't do these anymore, but I still enjoy solving problems from time to time.

I am very grateful to have worked with all these people and organizations. It would be very hard to maintain a list of all the people I have learned from, but I am thankful to all of them.
