I created [my first blog](https://barishdan.blogspot.com/) when I was just 12 years old, inspired by my father who is a journalist, columnist, and human rights activist.
The blog served as a modest experiment, allowing me to share intriguing discoveries and insights with others.

It was around that time I started to learn programming, and things got a bit busy to keep up with the blog.
Well, I couldn't keep up with it, but I always had the desire to write.

Then I started MIT and was pretty sure I would make a website in the first semester.
I was soon [drinking from the firehose](https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq/drinking-from-a-firehose/),
so the aspiration was postponed yet again.
When the current semester began almost a month ago, I bought this domain to force myself to make a website.
In my todo list, I created a "make barish.me" task for the next day.
MIT being MIT, every single day I had to push the task to the next day.
Finally, it happened!
Funnily enough, I'm writing this post not on the day I made this website, but much later due to the same reasons.

I will try to keep it simple and write as much as I can â€” probably most about software, but hopefully about other things too.
I often get those great ideas that I want to share with the world, but I never get to write them down,
so hopefully this is another way to push me to do that.
