This past few months were pretty hectic, but I'm glad to be back.

It's nearing the end of 2023, which is crazy to think about.
I had bunch of highligts this year, but I'll save that for another post (hopefully?).
For now, let's talk about what I'm doing this winter.
As soon as I was done with my classes and the infamous Leiserchess project of 6.1060, I flew back home.
Things have been pretty chill since then, and I'm enjoying my time off.
But there's important things to do!

On top of my priority, I have spending quality time with my family.
It's quite lucky that I get to see my whole family this winter,
even though my younger sister is arriving the same day as I'm leaving.
Luckily, the weather here is pretty good so far even though it's winter.

Here's a non-prioritized list of things I want to at least have an attempt at:
- Last winter I taught [Winter Camp](https://tedbilik.github.io/kamp/) to teach competitive programming.
I want to do it again this year, but with the help of more people teaching.
- I want to do a few education-related projects. One of them include a course management app,
another one is an exam app, and one might be an LMS-like tool. I am not reinventing the wheel;
these apps are specifically designed to help in my country who has more specific needs.
My current preferred tech stack is Vue 3 with Naive UI and [my own backend framework](https://github.com/BarishNamazov/conception/) (currently based on Express.js, but I am looking to make it independent).
- Deploy my so-called "Orfoqrafiya Bot" to the web. I am looking to buy a domain for this one.
It's a simple app that helps you find the correct spelling of the word. It was on Telegram for a while but then
Heroku decided to make their services paid, and I was too broke back then.
- Start on my newish research. I'll explain this in more details in a separete post,
but imagine a no-code tool that also provides you the full runnable and clean source code of what you built.
- Polish [Fuiz](https://fuiz.us) even more. Mainly, my friend Adhami is working on this one, but I advise.
You never need Kahoot! again.
- Read more blog posts.
- Write more blog posts.

We will see how many of these I can get done.
